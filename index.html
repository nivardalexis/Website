				Nanjing
			</h1>
			As one of the most attractive major cities in China, Nanjing is situated in the lower reach of the Yangtze River. It sports a long historical heritage and has served as the capitals of six dynasties. In Chinese language, Nanjing means "southern capital". Most of the Nanjing's attractions are reminders of the city's past glory, especially under the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
			<br>
			<br>
			With the Yangtze River on the north side, and surrounded on the other three sides by hills, Nanjing was thought to be auspicious as well as strategically important. The Nanjing area has been inhabited for about 5000 years, and a number of prehistoric sites have been discovered in or around the city.
			<br>
			<br>
			Today, Nanjing is the capital city of Jiangsu Province, covering an area of 6,421 square kilometers with a population of over 5.37 million. Its industries included machine-manufacture, automobile, assembly, electronics, petroleum, iron and steel, textile, shipbuilding and foodstuff.
